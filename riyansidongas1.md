Night settles slowly over the land, the sky deepening into a velvet black stitched with cold, brilliant stars. Arin unrolls the map beneath their light, watching as faint lines shimmer and shift, realigning themselves with the constellations overhead. What once seemed like meaningless symbols now form a clear path, pointing beyond the jagged hills toward a place the daylight had carefully hidden. Relief washes over Arin—this was the right choice. The map had been waiting for the sky to speak.

But as the stars burn brighter, the darkness around the camp grows restless. Soft footfalls circle just beyond the fire’s reach, and unfamiliar eyes glint low to the ground, reflecting starlight with quiet hunger. Arin senses the change too late, fingers tightening around the map as a low, collective breath rises from the shadows. The night has given up its secrets—and awakened its guardians.

A twig snaps behind Arin, sharp as a warning bell, and the fire gutters as if afraid. Shapes begin to peel themselves from the darkness—too tall to be wolves, too silent to be men—moving with the patience of things that know the night belongs to them. Arin backs toward the dying flames, heart hammering, the map now burning faintly as though aware of the danger it has summoned. Above, the stars seem to shift once more, not guiding this time, but watching. And in that terrible stillness, Arin realizes the path forward will demand more than courage—it will demand survival.
