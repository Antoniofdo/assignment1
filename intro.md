At dawn, when the fog still clung to the earth like a living thing, Arin discovered the map hidden beneath the loose stone of the old watchtower. Its edges were burnt, its ink faint, yet one symbol stood out clearly—a mark no one in the village dared to name. As Arin stepped beyond the safety of the familiar road, the wind shifted, carrying with it the distant roar of something ancient awakening. With only a compass that refused to point north and a choice that could not be undone, Arin moved forward, unaware that every step from this moment would lead to a different fate, depending on which path was taken next

Arin decides to trust the strange symbol on the map and follows it into the dense forest, where the trees grow so close together that daylight barely reaches the ground.
